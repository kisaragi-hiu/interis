# Interis

Preview `replace-regexp-in-string` results interactively, sort of like [Awk-ward](https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/awk-ward.nvim).

This is useful for interactively testing a regular expression on different inputs.

## Usage

`M-x interis RET` enters Interis. Fill out the fields; the output will be updated in real time. The fields are not constrained to one line.
